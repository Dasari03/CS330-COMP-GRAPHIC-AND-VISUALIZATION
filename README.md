1. How do I approach designing software?
When I'm designing software, I typically begin by analyzing the project's requirements as thoroughly as I can so that I have a good high-level overview of what it is exactly that I'm creating. Once that's done, I then begin tasking out all of the project's components into category buckets for work distribution later. Once that's done, I then start actually developing the items at hand. 

2. How do I approach developing programs?
When it comes to actually creating the software, I create a functional minimum-viable product to show to my client to show that the concept works and to initate the feedback look for making the program as user-tailored as possible. The rest of the development time is simply more of these dev/feedback cycles.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science fulfills my desire for my daily life and goals in many different ways. I love the IT field and the environment and works really fine with me.
